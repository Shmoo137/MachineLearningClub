Resources about reservoir computing and its physical realizations

# TL;DR
Reservoir Computers (RCs) are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) where only a single layer -- usually the output layer -- is trained. As long as the non-trained 'reservoir' satisfies certain conditions, training RCs can be a fast way to classify, interpret, or generate data. Turns out, some physical systems can be used as RCs.
